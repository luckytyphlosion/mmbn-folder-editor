This program has two functions listed below:

=== Creating a save with a selected navi and a folder ===
1. Create a text file with the navi name as the first line and the chips you want in your folder for the 2nd to 31st lines.
- You must use the exact same chip names as the ones in game, WITH the exception of Z Saver, which you input as Z-Saver.
  - Refer to https://bit.ly/EXE45PVPChipDoc
- Add [REG] at the end of a chip to reg it.
- An example folder is provided with the program.
2. Drag the text file on the batch script called "bn45_pvp_patch_folder_editor.bat"
3. READ WHAT THE PROGRAM PRINTS. It will explain every error on each line in the folder and provide suggestions for typos.
4. If successful, the program will automatically import the save into Tango's save folder.

=== Extracting all folders from a save ===
1. Drag an EXE4.5 PVP Patch save onto the batch script called "bn45_pvp_patch_folder_editor.bat"
2. If successful, the program will create a folder with the save name containing each navi's folder. These can be imported into a save.
